      I've been trying to learn Rust for a while now, but I just can't get it.
      I've tried reading the book, but it's just so dry. I've tried watching
      videos, but they're all so long. I've tried reading blog posts, but they
      all seem to be written by people who already know Rust. I've tried
      reading the source code, but it's just so hard to understand. I've tried

    title: "404's should not be expected behavior"

      ## The Problem
      
      I have noticed over the years that REST API endpoints have been abused. This
      is an honest mistake that anyone can make.  The problem is related to observability
      and the ability to monitor the health of your API.  The problem is that 404's
      will create noise in your monitoring system if they are not properly used.


      The original intent of the 404 status code was to indicate that the resource was
      not found and should be considered an error.  This was in the days where you had static
      web pages and an index page where it would link to other pages on the site.  If the index page
      had a link to a page that did not exist, then the user would get a 404 error.  This was a good
      thing because it would indicate that the link was broken and needed to be fixed.


      When building a REST compliant API, the 404 status code is used to indicate the resource pointed to
      by the URL is not found.  Where the problem comes in is that a client might consider using this endpoint
      to check if the resource exists or not.  This is a bad idea because it will create noise in your monitoring.


      If you are calling an endpoint and a 404 is expected behavior, then you are not using the API correctly.

      ## The Solution
      
      The solution is to provide a search endpoint similar to the index.html.  This endpoint will always return a list 
      and a status of 200 success.  This endpoint should can provide a query or filter mechanism to find specific resources.
      Anything that matches the pattern provided by the client should be returned in an array.  If nothing matches, then
      an empty array should be returned.  This will allow the client to check if the resource exists or not without
      creating noise in your monitoring system.

      ## An Example

      A search endpoint should return a 200 response with an empty result set if no results are found:
      ``
      GET /api/users?id={id} 
      200 OK
      []
      ``
      
      A lookup endpoint should return a 404 response if no results are found:
      ``
      GET /api/users/{id} 
      404 Not Found
      ``
     
      ## Conclusion
      
      Properly designing your REST endpoints and the contract between you and your clients is important.  You will need to
      think through how your API will be used and document how it should be used.  This will help you and your clients
      to avoid making mistakes.  Reliability, Scalability and Observability are key to providing a solid product.  A well designed
      contract will make your life easier and your clients happier.
